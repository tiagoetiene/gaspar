======

Gaspar is a simple tool for generating random scalar fields with known topology. The main purpose of the tool is to help users verify isosurface extraction algorithms. In addition to the scalar field, the tool  also provides the *expected topology* of the isosurface at the level-set 0. Randomly generated scalar fields can generate many interesting isosurfaces with lots of holes and connected components. Example:

![Isolevel 0 for a randomly generated grid](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Isolevel 0 for a randomly generated grid")
